        <p class="description">
          <span class="yellow">The Internet</span> has revolutionized nearly every industry on the planet, and basketball shoes
          are no exception. Recently, young sneakerheads
          have found themselves paying <span class="yellow">hundreds and
          thousands of dollars for kicks</span> - that is, when
          they can even find them for sale. Long lines and
          quick online sellouts have led to a burgeoning
          resale market. eBay, Craigslist, and social media
          sites have been the way for many to find their
          fashionable footwear. But where the market is
          free, it can be costly.

        <img src="jordangraph.svg" class="graphimg" />
        <p class="description">
          In fact, when adjusted for inflation, the price of the most popular shoes <span class="yellow">wasn&rsquo;t higher over the last fifteen years than it was in the 	&rsquo;80s and 	&rsquo;90s.</span> The Air Jordan line has released a shoe every year but two since 1985, and prices have remained pretty consistent.

        <p class="description">
          Anticipated sneakers are released in such limited supply, many people can't get them directly. Online resales make up an increasingly significant section of the sneaker industry, accounting for <span class="yellow">nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in 2014</span> - a quarter of that on eBay.

        <img src="jordanresale.png" class="graphimg" />
        <p class="description">
          Even as retail prices of Jordan line shoes remain stagnant, the average buyer is <span class="yellow">paying about 55% more</span> to buy them, thanks to low supply in a free online market.
